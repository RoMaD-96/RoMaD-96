# Description

This is the first R package allowing for the estimation, visualization and prediction of the most well-known football models: double Poisson, bivariate Poisson, Skellam, student-t, diagonal-inflated bivariate Poisson, and zero-inflated Skellam. The package allows Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) estimation through the underlying [Stan](https://mc-stan.org/) environment and Maximum Likelihood estimation (MLE, for 'static' models only).

# Installation

-   You can install the released version of `footBayes` from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/footBayes/index.html) with:

``` r
install.packages("footBayes", dependencies = TRUE)
```

-   Alternatively, you can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/LeoEgidi/footBayes) with

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("leoegidi/footBayes")
```
