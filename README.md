# About Quarto

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is "an open-source scientific and publishing system built on Pandoc" that allows you to natively write and render code chunks with Python, R, Julia, Observable, and more. With Quarto, you can publish high-quality articles, reports, presentations, websites, blogs, and books in HTML, PDF, MS Word, ePub, and more.

While [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is not going anywhere, Quarto represents a more advanced and simpler successor to the R Markdown framework. If you're an R programmer comfortable with R Markdown, you should feel zero change by moving to Quarto. If you're a Python programmer comfortable with rendering Jupyter notebooks to print and HTML formats, you will also feel at home with Quarto. If you're completely new to this type of system, the Quarto homepage has a ton of great resources including a robust [gallery](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/) from which you can gain ideas and inspiration.
