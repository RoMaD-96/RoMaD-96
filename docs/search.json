We operate a bit like a portfolio management company, albeit, somewhat under the radar - By that I mean, despite Centene generating revenues of $154 billion (USD) in 2023 and landing us on the Fortune 25 list, ‚ÄúCentene‚Äù is not particularly a household name like other national health insurance companies such as Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield, Kaiser Permanente, or United Healthcare‚Ä¶ This is largely by design and also because of the inorganic growth (via acquisitions) that Centene has made over the last 10 years.\nCentene operates its health plans at the State level and it is these brand names that have become household names in the respective communities they serve, e.g., Health Net (our California offering), Peach State Health Plan (our Georgia plan), Superior HealthPlan (our Texas plan), Fidelis (our New York plan), WellCare, Ambetter, etc.\nCentene is a publicly traded, ‚Äúmanaged care‚Äù health insurance carrier that primarily works with government-sponsored insurance products. The bulk of our members are on Medicaid (low-income households) and Medicare (65 and older). Managed care is a type of health insurance plan that aims to reduce costs while maintaining high quality of care. Managed care plans have contracts with medical facilities and health care providers to provide care for members at reduced costs."

On a regular basis, I get to work with GitLab (git repos and CI/CD), Jupyter Hub, VS Code (for Python), RStudio (for R), Databricks (for experimentation, training with Spark clusters, feature store management, model registry, and serving LLM model endpoints), Snowflake (data warehouse), Kubernetes (orchestration), AWS (storage), and those are just some of the many tools that I regularly use. Some teams develop more on the Microsoft Azure stack, some are more focused on chat bots, statistics, web app development, several teams are already developing and deploying GenAI + LLM solutions‚Ä¶ LOTS of interesting things going on at Centene and I‚Äôd recommend this place to anybody who is driven and eager to learn/share new methods around data and ML/AI.\nI help plan meetups and workshops with Centene‚Äôs R User Group and we have 100-150 regular attendees from across the country.

    "text": "Abstract\nOver the last few years, there has been a growing interest in the prediction and modelling of competitive sports outcomes, with particular emphasis placed on this area by the Bayesian statistics and machine learning communities. In this paper, we have carried out a comparative evaluation of statistical and machine learning models to assess their predictive performance for the 2022 FIFA World Cup and the 2023 CAF Africa Cup of Nations by evaluating alternative summaries of past performances related to the involved teams. More specifically, we consider the Bayesian Bradley-Terry-Davidson model, which is a widely used statistical framework for ranking items based on paired comparisons that have been applied successfully in various domains, including football. The analysis was performed including in some canonical goal-based models both the Bradley-Terry-Davidson derived ranking and the widely recognized Coca-Cola FIFA ranking commonly adopted by football fans and amateurs.\n\n\nAdditional Material\n\nPaper link: https://doi.org/10.1007/s00180-024-01585-z\nSource code: https://github.com/RoMaD-96/Bayesian_BTD\n\n\n\nCode Notes\n\nTo reproduce the code use the footBayes version 0.2.0\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nInvestigating population structure, parameters, and growth over time is vital for conserving endangered taxa like the Apennine yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata pachypus) in Italy. The Apennine yellow-bellied toad faces habitat loss or degradation, disease, and climate change threats. Our study delves into the population dynamics of this endemic amphibian by monitoring populations in two breeding sites within the Pollino National Park (Southern Italy) using a five-year Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) approach. With a particular emphasis on demographic parameters such as population size, detectability, survival, temporary emigration probability, and body condition index, the research aims to contribute to understanding population dynamics and inform con- servation efforts. We used two CMR models to estimate these parameters: Jolly-Seber with POPAN para- metrisation and Pollock‚Äôs robust design with Huggins‚Äô estimator. Results showed variation in body size between males and females, challenging previous findings in south-central Italy. For both populations, demographic data indicate high annual adult survival, fidelity to the breeding areas, support for no movement, and minimal trap response. Abundance over the years reveals a slight decline in one site and a gradual increase in the other. The estimated maximum population size indicated ~ 92 animals in one population and ~ 70 in the other one. Despite the high conservation concern for the Apennine yellow-bellied toad, there remains a dearth of quantitative in- formation on demographic aspects in Southern Italy. The findings underscore the importance of protected areas in biodiversity conservation and contribute to understanding the B. v. pachypus conservation status, suggesting that small, isolated populations may be vulnerable to unpredictable fluctuations, inbreeding depression, and extinction risks. Additionally, the research emphasises the importance of long-term CMR studies to gain insights into population dynamics and develop effective conservation strategies and management practices, particularly in the face of climate changes that may impact both the endemic taxon and its habitat.\n\n\nAdditional Materials\n\nPaper link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2024.126656\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "text": "Abstract\nOur goal was to assess the short- and long-term outcomes of surgical treatment for hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy in patients \\(‚â•65\\) years of age compared to patients \\(&lt; 65\\) years of age. Sixty-four patients aged \\(‚â•65\\) years, surgically treated for symptomatic hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy, were compared to a control group of \\(125\\) patients \\(&lt;65\\) years. Patients aged \\(‚â•65\\) years were less frequently male (\\(36\\%\\) vs \\(68\\%\\), \\(P&lt;0.001\\)) and had higher EuroSCORE II scores [\\(1.4 (1.1‚Äì2.2)\\) vs \\(0.8 (0.7‚Äì1.2)\\), \\(P&lt;0.001\\)], lower risk of sudden death, higher pulmonary artery pressure [\\(40 (30‚Äì50)\\) vs \\(30 (30‚Äì43)\\), \\(P=0.04\\)) and more mitral annulus calcifications (\\(44\\%\\) vs \\(14\\%\\), \\(P&lt;0.001\\)) compared to younger patients. Hospital death was \\(1\\%\\), with no difference between the 2 groups (\\(1.5\\%\\) vs \\(0.8\\%\\), \\(P=0.9\\)). Patients aged \\(‚â•65\\) years had more concomitant coronary bypass grafting (\\(12\\%\\) vs \\(5\\%\\), \\(P=0.05\\)) and a higher incidence of blood transfusions (\\(50\\%\\) vs \\(17\\%\\), \\(P&lt;0.001\\)) and postoperative atrial fibrillation (\\(19\\%\\) vs \\(8\\%\\), \\(P=0.02\\)). Follow-up was \\(98\\%\\) complete [median \\(8.3 (5.3‚Äì12.8)\\) years]. The 13-year survival in the group aged \\(‚â•65\\) was \\(54 (SD: 9) \\%\\) vs \\(83 (SD: 5) \\%\\) in the control group (\\(P&lt;0.001\\)), but it was comparable to that expected in the age-sex matched general national population. At 13 years, the cumulative incidence function of cardiac death in the elderly group was \\(19 (SD: 7)\\%\\), mostly unrelated to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy causes. At the last follow-up, \\(90\\%\\) of patients were in New York Heart Association functional class I-II and \\(68\\%\\) were in sinus rhythm. Selected elderly symptomatic patients with hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy can benefit from surgery, with low hospital mortality and morbidity, relief of symptoms and late survival comparable to that expected in the age-sex matched general population.\n\n\nAdditional Materials\n\nPaper link: https://doi.org/10.1093/ejcts/ezac229\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
