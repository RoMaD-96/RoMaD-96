We operate a bit like a portfolio management company, albeit, somewhat under the radar - By that I mean, despite Centene generating revenues of $154 billion (USD) in 2023 and landing us on the Fortune 25 list, “Centene” is not particularly a household name like other national health insurance companies such as Aetna, BlueCross BlueShield, Kaiser Permanente, or United Healthcare… This is largely by design and also because of the inorganic growth (via acquisitions) that Centene has made over the last 10 years.\nCentene operates its health plans at the State level and it is these brand names that have become household names in the respective communities they serve, e.g., Health Net (our California offering), Peach State Health Plan (our Georgia plan), Superior HealthPlan (our Texas plan), Fidelis (our New York plan), WellCare, Ambetter, etc.\nCentene is a publicly traded, “managed care” health insurance carrier that primarily works with government-sponsored insurance products. The bulk of our members are on Medicaid (low-income households) and Medicare (65 and older). Managed care is a type of health insurance plan that aims to reduce costs while maintaining high quality of care. Managed care plans have contracts with medical facilities and health care providers to provide care for members at reduced costs."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nInvestigating population structure, parameters, and growth over time is vital for conserving endangered taxa like the Apennine yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata pachypus) in Italy. The Apennine yellow-bellied toad faces habitat loss or degradation, disease, and climate change threats. Our study delves into the population dynamics of this endemic amphibian by monitoring populations in two breeding sites within the Pollino National Park (Southern Italy) using a five-year Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) approach. With a particular emphasis on demographic parameters such as population size, detectability, survival, temporary emigration probability, and body condition index, the research aims to contribute to understanding population dynamics and inform con- servation efforts. We used two CMR models to estimate these parameters: Jolly-Seber with POPAN para- metrisation and Pollock’s robust design with Huggins’ estimator. Results showed variation in body size between males and females, challenging previous findings in south-central Italy. For both populations, demographic data indicate high annual adult survival, fidelity to the breeding areas, support for no movement, and minimal trap response. Abundance over the years reveals a slight decline in one site and a gradual increase in the other. The estimated maximum population size indicated ~ 92 animals in one population and ~ 70 in the other one. Despite the high conservation concern for the Apennine yellow-bellied toad, there remains a dearth of quantitative in- formation on demographic aspects in Southern Italy. The findings underscore the importance of protected areas in biodiversity conservation and contribute to understanding the B. v. pachypus conservation status, suggesting that small, isolated populations may be vulnerable to unpredictable fluctuations, inbreeding depression, and extinction risks. Additionally, the research emphasises the importance of long-term CMR studies to gain insights into population dynamics and develop effective conservation strategies and management practices, particularly in the face of climate changes that may impact both the endemic taxon and its habitat.\n\n\nAdditional Material\n\nPaper link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jnc.2024.126656\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

Hospital death was \\(1\\%\\), with no difference between the 2 groups (\\(1.5\\%\\) vs \\(0.8\\%\\), \\(P=0.9\\)). Patients aged \\(≥65\\) years had more concomitant coronary bypass grafting (\\(12\\%\\) vs \\(5\\%\\), \\(P=0.05\\)) and a higher incidence of blood transfusions (\\(50\\%\\) vs \\(17\\%\\), \\(P&lt;0.001\\)) and postoperative atrial fibrillation (\\(19\\%\\) vs \\(8\\%\\), \\(P=0.02\\)). Follow-up was \\(98\\%\\) complete [median \\(8.3 (5.3–12.8)\\) years]. The 13-year survival in the group aged \\(≥65\\) was \\(54 (SD: 9) \\%\\) vs \\(83 (SD: 5) \\%\\) in the control group (\\(P&lt;0.001\\)), but it was comparable to that expected in the age-sex matched general national population.

    "section": "",
    "text": "Abstract\nIn the Bayesian framework power prior distributions are increasingly adopted in clinical trials and similar studies to incorporate external and past information, typically to inform the parameter associated with a treatment effect. Their use is particularly effective in scenarios with small sample sizes and where robust prior information is available. A crucial component of this methodology is represented by its weight parameter, which controls the volume of historical information incorporated into the current analysis. Although this parameter can be modeled as either fixed or random, eliciting its prior distribution via a full Bayesian approach remains challenging. In general, this parameter should be carefully selected to accurately reflect the available historical information without dominating the posterior inferential conclusions. A novel simulation-based calibrated Bayes factor procedure is proposed to elicit the prior distribution of the weight parameter, allowing it to be updated according to the strength of the evidence in the data. The goal is to facilitate the integration of historical data when there is agreement with current information and to limit it when discrepancies arise in terms, for instance, of prior-data conflicts. The performance of the proposed method is tested through simulation studies and applied to real data from clinical trials.\n\n\nAdditional Material\n\nPaper link: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.csda.2025.108180\nSource code: https://github.com/RoMaD-96/CBFpp\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"

    "text": "Abstract\nReplication of scientific studies is important for assessing the credibility of their results. However, there is no consensus on how to quantify the extent to which a replication study replicates an original result. We propose a novel Bayesian approach for replication studies based on mixture priors. The idea is to use a mixture of the posterior distribution based on the original study and a non-informative distribution as the prior for the analysis of the replication study. The mixture weight then determines the extent to which the original and replication data are pooled. Two distinct strategies are presented: one with fixed mixture weights, and one that introduces uncertainty by assigning a prior distribution to the mixture weight itself. Furthermore, it is shown how within this framework Bayes factors can be used for formal testing of relevant scientific hypotheses, such as tests on the presence or absence of an effect or whether the mixture weight equals zero (completely discounting the original data) or one (fully pooling with the original data). To showcase the practical application of the methodology, we analyze data from three replication studies. Our findings suggest that mixture priors are a valuable and intuitive alternative to other Bayesian methods for analyzing replication studies, such as hierarchical models and power priors. We provide the free and open source R package that implements the proposed methodology.\n\n\nAdditional Material\n\nStatistical Science future papers link: https://imstat.org/journals-and-publications/statistical-science/statistical-science-future-papers/\nSource code: https://github.com/RoMaD-96/MixRep\n\n\n\n\n\nReuseCC BY 4.0"
