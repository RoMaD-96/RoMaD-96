# Abstract

Investigating population structure, parameters, and growth over time is vital for conserving endangered taxa like
the Apennine yellow-bellied toad (Bombina variegata pachypus) in Italy. The Apennine yellow-bellied toad faces
habitat loss or degradation, disease, and climate change threats. Our study delves into the population dynamics
of this endemic amphibian by monitoring populations in two breeding sites within the Pollino National Park
(Southern Italy) using a five-year Capture-Mark-Recapture (CMR) approach. With a particular emphasis on
demographic parameters such as population size, detectability, survival, temporary emigration probability, and
body condition index, the research aims to contribute to understanding population dynamics and inform con-
servation efforts. We used two CMR models to estimate these parameters: Jolly-Seber with POPAN para-
metrisation and Pollock’s robust design with Huggins’ estimator. Results showed variation in body size between
males and females, challenging previous findings in south-central Italy. For both populations, demographic data
indicate high annual adult survival, fidelity to the breeding areas, support for no movement, and minimal trap
response. Abundance over the years reveals a slight decline in one site and a gradual increase in the other. The
estimated maximum population size indicated ~ 92 animals in one population and ~ 70 in the other one. Despite
the high conservation concern for the Apennine yellow-bellied toad, there remains a dearth of quantitative in-
formation on demographic aspects in Southern Italy. The findings underscore the importance of protected areas
in biodiversity conservation and contribute to understanding the B. v. pachypus conservation status, suggesting
that small, isolated populations may be vulnerable to unpredictable fluctuations, inbreeding depression, and
extinction risks. Additionally, the research emphasises the importance of long-term CMR studies to gain insights
into population dynamics and develop effective conservation strategies and management practices, particularly
in the face of climate changes that may impact both the endemic taxon and its habitat.
